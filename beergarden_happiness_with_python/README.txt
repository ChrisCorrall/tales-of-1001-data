With another heat wave just coming up, I wanted to find out where a good place for enjoying a nice chilled drink (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) outside would be in my hometown Edinburgh. So I combined an open data set about chair permits with some geo-coding and created an interactive map of places with outside seating in Edinburgh.
